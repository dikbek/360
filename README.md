This is a basic setup for a 360 degree photo portfolio.

There are eight sections, but it can be easily customised with some basic js tweaks

Upload your HDRIs to https://matheowis.github.io/HDRI-to-CubeMap/ to create cube maps from them.

Replace mine with yours, tweak the text, voila.

Still figuring out how to chage the text colour for current image.
